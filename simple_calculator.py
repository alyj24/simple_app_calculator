    print("Great Day, a precious well-being!")
    selection = input("Pick a basic math operation among these four (+|-|*|/): ")
# use try and except function
# ask the user for two variables to solve
# recognize the two input numbers and solve for the choice of operation
# print the output
# once again, ask the user if want to try again or not
